# [Projet 1 : Data cleaning and transformation](https://github.com/JessAhdj/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/main/Projet%201)
<p> In this project, I'll focus on the pre-treating of a dataset before use for analysis. For this, let's clean and make more clear a dataset of over 20 000 chess games, collected from a selection of users on the popular chess site Lichess.org, who happens to have some stranges values probably miss converted and missing some importants informations. </p>
<p> Dataset : Chess Game Dataset (Lichess) ; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess </p>
<p> Tool used : Python (Pandas) </p>

# [Projet 2 : Data analysis](https://github.com/JessAhdj/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/main/Projet%202)
<p> In this project, I'll focus on the pre-treating, the analysis and some visualisation of the streamable content of Netflix. For this, let's dive into a dataset of over 8000 TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2021, aswell as their metadata, to discover what the data has to tell us. </p>
<p> Dataset : Netflix Movies and TV Shows ; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows </p>
<p> Tool used : Python (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly) </p>

# [Projet 3 : Data visualisation](https://github.com/JessAhdj/DataScience-Portfolio/tree/main/Projet%203)
<p> In this project, I'll focus on the visualization of the "Bike Share Program" usage in London between 2015-2017. For this, let's take a look at the amount of bikes rented every hour and it's related parameters, to try and see if there are factors effecting the booking of the cycles and to find the relation between the season, weather or working day with user rental by building a dahsbord with Tableau. </p>
<p> Dataset : London bike sharing dataset ; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset </p>
<p> Tools used : Python (quick cleaning and transformation with Pandas) and Tableau </p>

# Projet 4 : EDA - all in one projet with Python - WIP
<p> Dataset : Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 ; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023 </p>
<p> Tool used : Python </p>

# Projet 5 : Data engineering (pipeline + data modeling) / data science (machine learning) - WIP
